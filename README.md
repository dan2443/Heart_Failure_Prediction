# heart_failure_prediction
In part of Machine learning seminar, our goal was to analyze a dataset with machine learning algoritems to predict an outcome.
Me and my partner decided to take this dataset from Kaggle:

## Introduction:

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide.
Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.

Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.


## Machine Learning algorithms used in this project:

* Logistic Regression
* Backpropagation
* Naive Bayes Classifier


### Logistic Regression:

Logistic Regression is a statistical model which used to find the probability of an appearance, in our case the probability of our patient to die by heart faliure.
The Logistic Regression algoritem is based on Linear Regression but improved by using Sigmoid and ln functions.
